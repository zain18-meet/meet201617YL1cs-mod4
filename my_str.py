        #Make this method work in the way described in
        #the block comment above.
        #Hints:
        # 1. Remember that self is a MyStr object,
        #    and a MyStr object is also a str.
        #    However, remember that to call the replace
        #    method of str, you may need to use super
        # 2. The following str methods will be helpful:
        #       replace, lower, and upper
        # 3. There are multiple solutions, but you can
        #       do this in as little as 1 line.
        #YOUR CODE BELOW:
        #################
